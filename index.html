                <p>Lions can eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal - around a quarter of their body weight. </p>

            <div class="imgtext second">
                <img src="./images/elephant.jpg" alt="elephant"/>
                <button class="btn" id="elephant">Click for Sound</button>
                <p>An elephant‚Äôs skin is 2.5cm thick in most places.  The folds and wrinkles can retain up to 10 times more water than flat skin does.</p>

                <img src="./images/camel.jpg" alt="camel"/>
                <button class="btn" id="camel">Click for Sound</button>
                <p>Camels store fat in the hump, not water. They are born without a hump because the layer of fat does not develop until they eat solid food.</p>

                <img src="./images/frog1.jpg" alt="frog"/>
                <button class="btn" id="frog">Click for Sound</button>
                <p>Frogs,in order to protect themselves from predators while resting on leaves,make their skin nearly transparent by packing their red blood cells into their livers.</p>

                <img src="./images/cat.jpg" alt="cat"/>
                <button class="btn" id="cat">Click for Sound</button>
                <P>Cats have about 473 taste buds, which is far fewer than people (we have 9,000) or dogs (who have 1,700).They can taste savory, salty, and bitter flavors, but they don‚Äôt taste sweets.</P>

                <button class="btn" id="chimp">Click for Sound</button>
                <P>FACT-We share 95-98% of the same DNA with chimpanzees.<BR>Chimpanzees Have the Ability to Learn Human Languages such as Sign Language</P>

                <img src="./images/crow.jpg" alt="crow"/>
                <button class="btn" id="crow">Click for Sound</button>
                <p>Apart from their famous caw-caw, crows emit other sounds. Each one sends out a different message; cawing can be used as a territorial warning or a way for crows to signal their location to relatives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="imgtext eight">
                <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="dog"/>
                <button class="btn" id="dog">Click for Sound</button>
                <p>Dogs have a really great sense of smell.

                    Scientists believe that their sense of smell is between 10,000 and 100,000 times better than humans.
                    
                    Their sense of smell is so good that the police have dogs on their team to sniff out clues!</p>

                <img src="./images/duck.webp" alt="duck"/>
                <button class="btn" id="duck">Click for Sound</button>
                <p>The shape of ducks‚Äô eyes allows them to see things near and far simultaneously and in sharp focus. And since their eyes are located on either side of their head, they are able to see almost 340 degrees around.</p>

                <img src="./images/penguin.jpg" alt="eagle"/>
                <button class="btn" id="penguin">Click for Sound</button>
                <P>Penguins don't have teeth. They do have spines inside their beaks, however, that can look a little tooth-like. They also have these spines on their tongues‚Äîboth sets of spines point backwards. </P>
